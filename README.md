Jet Fighter Simulator 🚀✈️

Jet Fighter Simulator is an interactive 2D flight simulation game built in Python using Pygame, designed to provide an engaging and dynamic arcade-style flying experience. The game allows players to control a jet using a physical joystick (Arduino, HC-05, Bluetooth, or other serial-based controllers), simulating smooth aircraft motion, banking, and thrust-based flight physics in a visually immersive environment.

The simulator features a dynamic starfield background, optimized for performance, giving the impression of high-speed aerial travel. Players can maneuver their jet through space, performing banking turns and pitch adjustments while keeping track of speed and score via an on-screen HUD. The HUD displays essential flight information like current speed and accumulated points, enhancing gameplay feedback.

The project is fully modular and optimized, with separate classes and functions for starfield rendering, jet drawing, serial communication, HUD management, and main game loop operations. The jet graphics are pre-rendered and cached, enabling smooth rotations without lag. Similarly, star graphics use caching and randomized properties for realism and visual variety.

Key Features:

Real-time joystick input for precise control.

Optimized starfield with glowing and colored stars for immersive visuals.

Smooth jet animation with banking, pitch, and thrust physics.

Heads-Up Display (HUD) for speed and score tracking.

Modular and readable Python code for easy customization or extension.

Performance tracking with FPS reporting to ensure smooth gameplay.

This project is ideal for hobbyists learning Python, Pygame, and serial communication, or anyone interested in creating interactive simulations with custom controllers. It demonstrates efficient handling of input devices, physics-inspired motion, and graphical optimizations in Python.

Whether you want to experiment with flight physics, learn joystick integration, or just enjoy piloting a virtual jet through a beautiful starfield, this simulator provides a fun, educational, and fully customizable environment for exploration and gameplay.
